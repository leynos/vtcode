//! Terminal palette probe coordination.
//!
//! The OSC color probe ([`probe_and_cache_terminal_palette_harmony`]) does
//! blocking I/O on `/dev/tty` with up to a 200 ms timeout.  Starting it
//! synchronously in `run_single_agent_loop` delays the first TUI render by
//! that full duration.
//!
//! Instead, [`start_terminal_palette_probe`] spawns the probe on a blocking
//! thread early during bootstrap so it overlaps with startup-context
//! resolution (config loading, auth probing, theme determination).  The
//! agent loop then calls [`await_terminal_palette_probe`] just before
//! crossterm sets up the terminal — by which point the probe has typically
//! already completed.  This avoids a termios race (the probe's
//! `RawModeGuard` restore must not undo crossterm's raw mode) while
//! removing the probe from the user-visible critical path.
//!
//! # Correctness guarantees
//!
//! - **Race-safe**: a `PROBE_DONE` atomic flag is checked before waiting on
//!   the [`Notify`], so completion is observed even if the probe finishes
//!   before the awaiter registers its waiter.
//! - **Panic-safe**: a [`CompletionGuard`] sets `PROBE_DONE` and calls
//!   `notify_one()` in its `Drop`, so the awaiter is always released even
//!   if the probe panics inside `spawn_blocking`.
//! - **Fallback**: if the probe was never started (an unanticipated code
//!   path that still reaches the agent loop), [`await_terminal_palette_probe`]
//!   runs it synchronously, preserving the original behaviour.
//!
