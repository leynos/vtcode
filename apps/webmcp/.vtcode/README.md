# VT Code Dynamic Context Directory

This directory contains dynamic context files for VT Code agent operations.

## Directory Structure

```
.vtcode/
  context/
    tool_outputs/     # Large tool outputs spooled to files
  history/            # Conversation history during summarization
  mcp/
    tools/            # MCP tool descriptions and schemas
    status.json       # MCP provider status
  skills/
    INDEX.md          # Available skills index
    {skill_name}/     # Individual skill directories
  terminals/
    INDEX.md          # Terminal sessions index
    {session_id}.txt  # Terminal session output
```

## Purpose

These files implement **dynamic context discovery** - a pattern where large
outputs are written to files instead of being truncated. This allows the agent
to:

1. Inspect full tool-output files on demand with `exec_command.cmd` using `sed`,
   `cat`, or `rg`
2. Search code with advanced `code_search`, and search spooled text with
   `exec_command.cmd` plus `rg`
3. Recover conversation details lost during summarization
4. Discover available skills and MCP tools efficiently

## Configuration

Configure in `vtcode.toml`:

```toml
[context.dynamic]
enabled = true
tool_output_threshold = 8192  # Bytes before spooling
sync_terminals = true
persist_history = true
sync_mcp_tools = true
sync_skills = true
```
