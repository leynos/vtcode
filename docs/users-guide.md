## Patch safety in brief

`read_file` returns a whole-file `content_hash` alongside the text. Passing
that hash back to `apply_patch` as `expected_content_hash` makes the edit
conditional on the file still being the version the model read.

- If the hash matches, the patch applies normally.
- If the file changed, the patch is rejected before any write. The rejection
  carries `reason: "content_hash_mismatch"`, the supplied hash, the current
  hash, and a `next_action`. Reread the file and regenerate the patch against
  the new version; nothing on disk was touched.
- Omit `expected_content_hash` when the guarantee is not required. Add-only
  patches and patches with more than one source file must omit it; supplying it
  there returns `reason: "invalid_precondition_scope"`.

Independently of hashes, `apply_patch` compares each touched file's state
before and after the patch. A patch that would leave every file exactly as it
already is has no effect, so repeating the identical no-op is escalated rather
than silently accepted:

1. first attempt: reported as success with `"no_op": true` and
   `"occurrence": 1`,
2. second identical attempt: still accepted, but flagged with
   `"retry_prohibited": true` and a warning,
3. third identical attempt: refused with `reason: "repeated_identical_no_op"`.

Any patch that does change the files, or a materially different patch, resets
the sequence. The full behaviour, including how conflict and stale-file details
reach an ACP client, is in the [patch safety guide](./guides/patch-safety.md).
