# VT Code Tool Specifications

This document describes the public tool surface exposed to VT Code models after
the Codex-style tool migration.

## Public Profiles

| Profile | Tools | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Default | `exec_command`, `write_stdin`, `apply_patch`, `search_tools` | Normal repository work plus deferred capability discovery. |
| Advanced VT Code | Default tools plus `code_search` | Bounded workspace search for definitions, syntactic usages, literal text, and matching paths. |

No `unified_*` schema, alias, hidden public tool, or compatibility profile is
available after this migration. Those names are legacy external schema names
only and must not be used in new prompts, config examples, evals, or tool calls.

## Default Tools

### `exec_command`

Runs a shell command through the active shell profile. Permission-related
fields express stable request intent; the execution gateway resolves runtime
enforcement without changing the model-visible schema.

Required:

- `cmd`: command text.

Common optional fields:

- `workdir`: working directory.
- `tty`: allocate a PTY when the command needs an interactive terminal.
- `yield_time_ms`: how long to wait before returning output.
- `max_output_tokens`: output budget for the response.

Every function tool accepts `max_output_tokens`. It defaults to 10,000 and must
be between 1 and 50,000. VT Code spools the complete output and limits only the
model-visible preview.

The limit is validated during preflight before dispatch. Omit it to use the
10,000-token default or provide an integer override in that range; strings,
fractions, zero, and values above 50,000 are rejected. Execution-only approval
inputs such as `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` remain explicit
`exec_command` arguments and are not injected into tool descriptions or hidden
approval metadata.

Unix-like example:

```json
{"cmd":"rg -n \"ToolProfile\" vtcode-core","workdir":"/repo"}
```

PowerShell example:

```json
{"cmd":"Select-String -Path vtcode-core/**/*.rs -Pattern ToolProfile","workdir":"C:\\repo"}
```

### `write_stdin`

Sends input to a live session created by `exec_command`.

Required:

- `session_id`: identifier returned by a still-running command.
- `chars`: bytes or text to send.

Example:

```json
{"session_id":42,"chars":"q"}
```

Session identifiers are process-local and expire when the command finishes,
the session is closed, or VT Code restarts. A stale identifier returns a
non-retryable `ResourceNotFound` result with `reason: "stale_exec_session"`.
Start a new `exec_command` and use its returned session ID; VT Code does not
claim that the failed lookup could have made partial changes.

### `apply_patch`

Applies a freeform patch through VT Code's workspace-boundary and edit-safety
checks. Use it for file edits, additions, moves, and deletions when the model has
the patch tool. Successful responses include a bounded `diff` array with one
entry per planned file (`path`, `operation`, bounded unified `content`, and
available `additions`/`deletions`); no-op entries are marked `is_empty`. The
legacy single-file `diff_preview` response is normalized to this same shape by
the terminal and session renderers.

Every `apply_patch` path, including move sources and destinations, must be
workspace-relative. Absolute paths, `..`, and traversal-like path forms are
rejected; resolution also rejects an in-workspace symlink that leads outside the
workspace before any patch mutation begins.

After several effective mutations, anti-blind-editing temporarily allows reads,
inspection, task tracking, and verification while blocking further workspace
mutations until a verification command completes.

The checkpoint is cleared only by a successful verification command. Inspection,
link checks, and `git diff --check` are useful diagnostics but do not prove that
the requested build or tests pass. Failed mutations do not count as effective
mutations, and a blocked turn remains blocked even when its recovery response is
published successfully. The recovery response identifies the reason: pending
verification includes `cargo check --locked` and the relevant `cargo nextest run`
guidance; context-capacity recovery says that completed outputs were retained and
suggests resuming after reducing context or switching models; other blocked
turns receive a generic retry handoff.

Example:

```diff
*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: README.md
@@
-old text
+new text
*** End Patch
```

### `search_tools`

Searches the deferred local catalog by name and description. `query` is
required; `limit` is optional (1–25), and `detail_level` accepts `name`,
`name_description`, or `full`. Ranked matches are expanded deterministically
for the next request segment.

```json
{"query":"GitHub pull request review","limit":5,"detail_level":"name_description"}
```

## Advanced Code Search

`code_search` is available only when the advanced VT Code profile is enabled.
It accepts exactly five inputs:

- `query` is required and searched literally. A wholly lower-case query is
  case-insensitive; a query containing an upper-case character is
  case-sensitive.
- `path` optionally limits the search to one workspace file or directory.
- `file_types` optionally limits results by language name or common extension.
- `result_types` optionally selects `definition`, `usage`, `text`, or `path`.
- `max_results` optionally sets the returned limit from 1 to 100. It defaults
  to 20.

Definitions are recognised declarations with an exact matching name. Usages
are exact syntactic identifiers outside recognised declaration names. They are
not resolved references, so an unrelated identifier with the same spelling may
appear. Text results cover comments, strings, prose, configuration, and other
unclassified content. Path results match existing filenames or paths.

Omit `result_types` to search all four categories. Results are ordered by
category, then source location. `truncated: true` means the bounded search may
have more candidates; it does not report an exact repository-wide total.
Narrow `path`, `file_types`, or `result_types` in another call.

Example:

```json
{"query":"ToolProfile","path":"vtcode-core","file_types":["rust"],"result_types":["definition","usage"],"max_results":20}
```

Use `exec_command` or the specialised ast-grep skill for arbitrary structural
patterns.

## File Inspection

The default profile has no public `read_file` or `write_file` tools. This
matches the Codex core finding: file inspection uses shell commands, internal
filesystem affordances, or MCP tools when present, and edits use `apply_patch`.

Examples:

```json
{"cmd":"sed -n '1,120p' docs/tools/TOOL_SPECS.md"}
```

```json
{"cmd":"rg --files docs | sort"}
```

Separately named non-default file tools may be added later only if a concrete
use case justifies them. They must not reuse a legacy `unified_*` name.

## Platform Profiles

VT Code selects the model-facing shell guidance from `agent.shell_prompt_profile`.

| Platform | Default profile | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `unix_like` | Use Unix-like shell commands in `exec_command.cmd`. |
| macOS | `unix_like` | Use BSD-compatible flags where BSD tools differ. |
| WSL | `unix_like` | Recommended route for Unix-like workflows on Windows. |
| Native Windows | `powershell` | Use native PowerShell syntax. |

The setting accepts `auto`, `unix_like`, or `powershell`. It controls prompt
examples and expected command syntax only. VT Code does not translate GNU flags
for macOS BSD tools, and it does not translate Unix commands to PowerShell.

## Migration From Removed Schemas

External users of the removed legacy schemas must update their calls directly:

| Removed legacy schema | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `unified_exec` run | `exec_command` |
| `unified_exec` session input | `write_stdin` |
| `unified_file` patch or edit | `apply_patch` |
| `unified_file` read or write | Shell commands through `exec_command.cmd` by default, or separately named non-default tools if added later. |
| `unified_search` text search | `rg` or `grep` through `exec_command.cmd` |
| `unified_search` search | `code_search` in the advanced profile, using its five query-led inputs |
| `unified_search` web, skills, errors, discovery | Separate tools only where those affordances are retained. |

Short replacements:

```json
{"cmd":"rg -n \"struct ToolRegistration\" vtcode-core"}
```

```json
{"query":"ToolRegistration","path":"crates/codegen/vtcode-core/src/tools","file_types":["rust"],"result_types":["definition"]}
```
