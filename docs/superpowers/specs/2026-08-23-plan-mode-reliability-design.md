# Plan Mode Reliability Design

## Summary

Plan mode must reliably turn read-only repository discovery into a validated,
persisted plan and then hand approved work to a write-capable primary agent.
The visible workflow identity remains `plan`, but its behaviour becomes
discussion-first like `duck`: clarify material ambiguity early, inspect only
the evidence needed for a decision, and synthesize a compact plan instead of
continuing open-ended research.

This change also fixes the concrete failure captured in turns 985-987. A valid
shell verification using `target/release/vtcode` was rejected, the model then
tried to persist the plan through shell redirection, and the read-only gate
correctly denied that mutation. No canonical plan or task tracker was
published, so later `continue` messages had nothing approval-ready to execute.

## Goals

- Make plan discovery discussion-first and evidence-driven without changing
  the active workflow identity from `plan` to `duck`.
- Ask the user only when a material decision cannot be resolved from the
  repository or request.
- Persist completed plans exclusively through the canonical
  `<proposed_plan>` validation and persistence path.
- Accept safe workspace-relative executable paths in verification commands.
- Give actionable, bounded validation repair feedback that does not echo
  untrusted plan content into a system message.
- Preserve the validated approval boundary and reliably select `build` or
  `auto` for execution.
- Raise the plan-mode tool-loop floor from 40 to 60 while retaining existing
  wall-clock, tool-call, blocked-call, recovery, and hard-cap safeguards.

## Non-Goals

- Do not make `duck` the active agent or create a delegated duck child thread.
- Do not weaken plan mode's read-only command or filesystem boundary.
- Do not allow shell redirection, `apply_patch`, or arbitrary repository writes
  during planning.
- Do not bypass plan validation, task-tracker creation, or user approval.
- Do not change the ordinary build-mode tool-loop default of 40.
- Do not add a new top-level harness or planning configuration subsystem.

## Architecture

### Discussion-first planning persona

The built-in `plan` and `duck` prompts will share a small discussion-first
guidance fragment owned by `vtcode-config`. The shared guidance requires the
agent to identify ambiguity, ask focused questions, compare relevant options,
and stop researching when existing evidence supports a decision. Plan-specific
guidance then adds repository grounding, the canonical plan shape, and the
read-only workflow contract.

The plan prompt must explicitly say that the model never writes the plan file
with shell or file-editing tools. It emits exactly one `<proposed_plan>` block;
the runtime validates it, writes the plan and tracker artefacts, and opens the
approval gate. This removes the ambiguity that caused the model to attempt
`cat > .vtcode/plans/...` in turn 985.

The runtime planning guidance will repeat this boundary because primary-agent
prompts are user-overridable. The compiled system contract, not only the
built-in prompt, must tell every planning agent how canonical persistence
works.

### Read-only discovery tools

Plan mode retains its current plan-specific permissions: direct read/search
tools, `request_user_input`, and read-only `exec_command` calls remain
available, while the planning dispatch gate remains authoritative for shell
mutation detection.

The read-only shell classifier will recognize literal-output `printf` commands
used only to separate inspection output, including chains where every command
is independently read-only. Redirection, command substitution, dynamic shell
syntax, environment mutation, and mixed read/write chains remain denied.
Adversarial tests will cover `printf` combined with redirection, substitution,
and a destructive neighbour command.

### Plan validation and repair

Verification parsing will recognize a workspace-relative executable token when
it contains a path separator and every character is from a conservative path
alphabet. For example, these are commands:

- `target/release/vtcode --version`
- `scripts/perf/compare.sh before after`
- `./scripts/check-dev.sh --changed`

URLs, shell expressions, assignments without a following command, and prose
remain invalid. Validation is syntactic and does not require the path to exist,
because a plan may create the referenced script in an earlier step.

For bracketed verification lists, validation will report the one-based ordinal
of each invalid list entry using validator-owned text, such as
`verification item 2 must include a concrete command or check`. It will not
copy the rejected command into the system repair directive. The single bounded
repair pass remains unchanged.

### Canonical persistence and approval

The data flow remains:

1. The model explores through read-only tools and optionally calls
   `request_user_input`.
2. The model emits one `<proposed_plan>`.
3. Response processing extracts and validates the plan.
4. Canonical persistence writes the plan, its sidecar tracker, and the
   workspace task tracker.
5. Only after all artefacts are readable does the runtime emit plan-ready and
   approval-requested events.
6. Approval finishes planning, restores permissions, selects a write-capable
   primary agent, and begins the implementation turn.

The existing execution-agent resolver remains authoritative. A prior
write-capable `build` or `auto` agent is restored when possible. A read-only
`plan` or `duck` agent is never used for implementation; resolution falls back
to the configured write-capable default and then built-in `build`/`auto`.
Tests will cover current-context and fresh-context approval plus explicit
Build/Auto legacy selections.

### Planning budgets

`PLANNING_WORKFLOW_MIN_TOOL_LOOPS` increases from 40 to 60. An explicit zero
remains unlimited. Nonzero user values below 60, including the workspace's
current value of 20, resolve to 60 only while planning is active. Ordinary
turns retain their configured value, and the planning extension hard cap stays
240.

The supplied failure used 29 tool-loop batches, so this budget increase is
headroom rather than the root-cause fix. The discussion-first prompt and
existing tool-free synthesis recovery remain responsible for preventing the
extra capacity from becoming unbounded research.

## Error Handling and Safety

- Invalid plans are never persisted over an existing valid draft.
- A failed repair ends the turn with the rejected draft and validator-owned
  reasons visible; it never advertises that implementation can start.
- Missing plan or tracker artefacts keep planning active and prevent a mode
  transition.
- A denied or unavailable interview falls back to the existing bounded plain
  text/synthesis path.
- Read-only shell classification stays fail-closed for unknown or dynamic
  syntax.
- Approval does not enable mutations until plan and tracker persistence have
  succeeded and a write-capable primary agent has been selected.

## Testing

Implementation follows test-driven development. Regression coverage will
include:

- The turn-985 verification shape validates, including a bracket list whose
  second command starts with an environment assignment followed by
  `target/release/vtcode`.
- Unsafe relative-path lookalikes and shell expressions remain invalid.
- Repair feedback identifies an invalid verification-list ordinal without
  echoing its content.
- The compiled plan prompt says to emit `<proposed_plan>` and forbids manual
  plan-file persistence.
- `printf`-separated read-only inspection chains are admitted, while
  redirection, substitution, and destructive chains are denied.
- Configured loop limits of 20 resolve to 60 in planning and remain 20 outside
  planning; zero remains unlimited.
- A checkpoint-shaped streamed plan is validated, persisted with both
  trackers, emits approval events, and hands execution to `build` or `auto`.
- Existing planning, tool-policy, task-tracker, and approval tests remain
  green under `cargo nextest run`.

## Documentation and Module Guidance

Update the planning workflow guide and configuration quick references with the
discussion-first behaviour, canonical persistence boundary, relative command
validation, and 60-loop planning floor. Update compiled runtime guidance where
the model-facing contract is defined. After implementation, use the
`audit-module-agents` skill to determine whether `src/AGENTS.md`,
`vtcode-core/AGENTS.md`, or `vtcode-config/AGENTS.md` needs a concise invariant
update.
