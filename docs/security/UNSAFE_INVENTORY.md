# Unsafe Code Inventory

This is the maintainer inventory for VT Code's intentional unsafe Rust and FFI
boundaries. It complements the compiler and Clippy lint families in the root
`Cargo.toml` (`unsafe_code`, `undocumented_unsafe_blocks`,
`multiple_unsafe_ops_per_block`).

## Snapshot: 2026-08-10

The external audit reported 44 textual `unsafe` occurrences. That count also
includes prose, diagnostics, and test descriptions. The current source
inventory below contains 24 syntactic unsafe sites: unsafe operations,
`unsafe extern "C"` ABI declarations, the two allocator link attributes, and
test-only FFI callbacks.

## Native-plugin site breakdown

The 14 sites in `native_plugin.rs` are intentionally grouped by ABI boundary:

- Four `unsafe extern "C"` function-pointer type declarations define the
  plugin ABI (`PluginVersionFn`, `PluginMetadataFn`, `PluginExecuteFn`, and
  `PluginFreeStringFn`).
- `CStr::from_ptr` and the plugin free callback copy and then release a
  validated plugin-owned string.
- `Library::get` resolves only the fixed symbols from a canonicalized trusted
  library.
- The ABI version and metadata callbacks are called only after symbol loading;
  the execute callback receives a live `CString` and is serialized unless the
  plugin declares itself reentrant.
- `Library::new` is the privileged dynamic-library load and remains limited to
  canonical paths under trusted plugin directories.
- Test-only callbacks cover the matching free operation and delayed execution;
  their pointers are produced and reclaimed by the test fixtures.

## Change rule

Before adding an unsafe site:

1. Prefer a safe standard-library or crate wrapper.
2. Keep the smallest possible unsafe block and add a nearby `SAFETY:` comment
   stating the invariant, not merely that the operation is "trusted."
3. Add or update the corresponding row and site breakdown here.
4. Add a focused regression test for the invariant and run the relevant safety
   crate tests plus Clippy with `-D warnings`.

Unsafe code is not a substitute for command or sandbox policy. FFI plugins are
trusted native code and execute with user privileges; the command/sandbox
boundary remains governed by `vtcode-safety` and `vtcode-bash-runner`.
