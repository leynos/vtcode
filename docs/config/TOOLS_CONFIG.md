# Tools Configuration

This document describes the tools-related configuration in `vtcode.toml`.

- max_tool_loops: Maximum number of inner tool-call loops per user turn. The
  ordinary default is `40`. Plan raises smaller nonzero values to its `60`-loop
  floor; an explicit `0` means unlimited. Prompt-approved planning extensions
  remain bounded by the `240`-loop planning cap.
  - Configuration: `[tools].max_tool_loops` in `vtcode.toml`
  - Code default:
    `vtcode_config::constants::tool_limits::DEFAULT_MAX_TOOL_LOOPS`, consumed by
    `crates/codegen/vtcode-config/src/core/tools.rs`
  - Ordinary default: `40`
  - Plan floor: `60` (for configured nonzero values below the floor)
  - Explicit `0`: unlimited
  - Planning extension cap: `240`

Example:

```toml
[tools]
default_policy = "prompt"
max_tool_loops = 40
```

## Blocked-call limits and blocked handoffs

`max_consecutive_blocked_tool_calls_per_turn` controls the consecutive
blocked-call cap. The runtime also applies a bounded total fuse: normal mode
allows two times the configured cap, Plan Mode allows four times the cap, and
recovery mode retains the tighter configured cap — unless
`max_total_blocked_tool_calls_per_turn` sets an explicit total. Per-tool
overrides in `blocked_tool_thresholds` (e.g. `code_search = 6`) replace the
consecutive cap for that tool; `code_search` gets 2x headroom by default. These
limits apply consistently to policy/preflight denials and blocked execution
failures; the consecutive streak resets after an allowed call, while the total
count remains per turn. One attempt before the fuse, the runtime emits a
warning advisory with the streak/total counters and a per-tool remedy hint.

```toml
[tools]
max_consecutive_blocked_tool_calls_per_turn = 8
max_total_blocked_tool_calls_per_turn = 16

[tools.blocked_tool_thresholds]
exec_command = 3
code_search = 6
```

When the fuse stops a turn, VT Code emits `turn.blocked`
(streak/total/caps/last tool) alongside `turn.failed`, forces a session-history
checkpoint, pins referenced spool outputs so resume can still read them, and
creates the blocked handoff. A persisted archive produces a verified
`vtcode --resume <archive-id>` command. Disabled history or a failed checkpoint
produces a handoff without a resume command and states why resume is
unavailable. Interactive sessions remain available for the next user input; the
TUI shows a `Blocked` header badge, `Blocked • continue to retry…` footer hint,
and a transcript banner with resume guidance.

Runner paths without session-archive support likewise omit the resume command
instead of treating a runtime session ID as an archive identifier.

Tool outputs are rendered with ANSI styles in the chat interface. Tools should
return plain text.
