# vtcode-agent-plugins

Agent Plugins manifest parsing, validation, and discovery for VT Code.

## Overview

Implements a conformant
[Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) client. A plugin is a
directory containing a root `plugin.json` manifest, optional
`skills/*/SKILL.md` Agent Skills, and optional `mcp.json` MCP server
configuration. The crate parses and validates manifests, discovers bundled
skills and MCP servers, expands plugin environment placeholders, and enforces
path containment.

## Key Components

### Manifest

`PluginManifest::parse` requires `$schema` and `name`; all other fields are
optional. The `$schema` value must be a supported Agent Plugins schema URL;
unsupported or wrong-typed values are rejected. Unknown top-level fields are
non-fatal (reported via `unknown_fields`). Names must be 1-64 chars of `a-z`,
`0-9`, `-`, `.`, start and end alphanumeric, and contain no `--` or `..`.

### LoadedPlugin

`LoadedPlugin::load_from_dir` reads `plugin.json`, discovers
`skills/*/SKILL.md` (immediate children only), and parses `mcp.json`. Each
skill must pass the strict Agent Skills validation, and its `name` must match
its parent directory. A broken skill is skipped with a warning rather than
failing the whole plugin. An `mcp.json` schema version that differs from
`plugin.json` disables MCP for that plugin.

### Loader and Installer

- `PluginLoader` / `FileSystemPluginLoader` — load a plugin from a directory.
- `PluginInstaller` / `FileSystemPluginInstaller` — `install` clones a git URL
  (`--depth=1`) or copies a local directory into `~/.agents/plugins/<name>`,
  then loads and validates the result; `remove` deletes an installed plugin.
- Install and remove names are validated with the same rules as manifest names,
  so a crafted name such as `../evil` cannot escape the plugins root.
- Directory copies skip the source's `.git` directory and hidden files, follow
  symlinks by re-creating them (never dereferencing), and abort on symlink
  cycles.

### Expansion

For stdio MCP servers VT Code injects `PLUGIN_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_DATA`
environment variables and expands `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` / `${PLUGIN_DATA}`
placeholders in `args`, `env`, and `cwd`. `validate_plugin_relative` requires
`./`-prefixed paths and resolves them with `canonicalize`, so symlinks that
point outside the plugin root are rejected.

## Runtime Integration

- Skills: `vtcode-core::skills::loader` discovers plugin skills from
  `<workspace>/.agents/plugins`.
- MCP: `vtcode-core::mcp::plugin_providers::discover_plugin_mcp_providers`
  surfaces plugin MCP servers as `<plugin>.<server>` providers at session
  startup, from both the workspace and user plugin roots. `./`-prefixed stdio
  `command` and `cwd` values are resolved eagerly to canonical absolute paths
  inside the plugin root at discovery time, so the spawned process cannot
  escape the sandbox through symlinks.
