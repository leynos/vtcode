# WebMCP deployment reference

VT Code's maintained WebMCP browser app is published at two URLs. Both pages
use the same browser tool surface and start in safe in-memory fallback mode;
the ChatGPT Site is the primary hosted demonstration, while GitHub Pages is a
static fallback and reference deployment.

| Deployment   | URL                                   | Exact browser origin                 | Active pairing command                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ChatGPT Site | <https://vtcode.vinhnx.chatgpt.site/> | `https://vtcode.vinhnx.chatgpt.site` | `/webmcp pair https://vtcode.vinhnx.chatgpt.site` |
| GitHub Pages | <https://vinhnx.github.io/VTCode/>    | `https://vinhnx.github.io`           | `/webmcp pair https://vinhnx.github.io`           |

The page derives its origin from `window.location.origin`. The GitHub Pages
`/VTCode/` path is a URL path, not part of the origin; do not include it in a
pairing command or bridge allowlist. The same rule applies to ports on local or
custom deployments.

## Select a deployment

Use the [ChatGPT Site](https://vtcode.vinhnx.chatgpt.site/) when demonstrating
the browser WebMCP experience. Use
[GitHub Pages](https://vinhnx.github.io/VTCode/) when a stable static fallback
or repository-hosted reference is more useful. Neither page hosts the Rust
WebSocket bridge. Without an explicit bridge pairing, the editor remains
page-local and cannot read or write a local workspace.

Browser WebMCP and the VT Code bridge are separate interfaces:

- Browser WebMCP registers eight bounded, page-scoped tools through
  `document.modelContext` when the browser context supports it.
- The authenticated `/webmcp` WebSocket connects the page to VT Code for
  workspace reads, reviewed proposals, runtime events, and active agent turns.

The page can demonstrate the first interface without pairing. A real
`VT CODE TURN` requires the second interface and the same VT Code TUI session
that owns terminal approval.

## Pair either published page

Configure both exact production origins if the same active TUI should serve
both sites:

```toml
[webmcp]
allowed_origins = [
  "https://vtcode.vinhnx.chatgpt.site",
  "https://vinhnx.github.io",
]
```

Then run the command matching the open page:

```text
/webmcp pair https://vtcode.vinhnx.chatgpt.site
/webmcp pair https://vinhnx.github.io
```

When a bridge is already running, pairing another configured origin issues a
new one-time code and keeps existing authenticated sessions active. The pending
code is still single-use. Use `--replace` only when intentionally revoking
current browser sessions:

```text
/webmcp pair --replace https://vtcode.vinhnx.chatgpt.site
```

Paste the newest WebSocket URL and code into **Settings → Connect or re-pair a
VT Code bridge**. A loopback `ws://127.0.0.1:...` endpoint is reachable only
from a browser that can reach the same machine. A remote or sandboxed browser
needs a reachable `wss://` endpoint behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.

For a workspace-only headless bridge, repeat `--origin` for the exact origins
that should be accepted:

```sh
vtcode webmcp serve \
  --origin https://vtcode.vinhnx.chatgpt.site \
  --origin https://vinhnx.github.io \
  --allowed-root /absolute/path/to/workspace
```

The headless adapter does not execute active VT Code agent turns. Use an active
TUI pairing when the browser must send `VT CODE TURN` prompts.

## Origin trial and browser support

Chrome origin-trial tokens are bound to exact origins. For a build served at
both public URLs, provide one token for each origin through
`VITE_WEBMCP_ORIGIN_TRIAL_TOKENS`, separated by commas or whitespace. The
legacy singular `VITE_WEBMCP_ORIGIN_TRIAL_TOKEN` remains supported for a
single-origin build. The GitHub Pages workflow reads the corresponding
`WEBMCP_ORIGIN_TRIAL_TOKENS` Actions variable and injects the tokens into the
document head at build time; no token belongs in source control. If the ChatGPT
Site is built or uploaded separately, pass the same build variables to that
publisher as well; the Pages workflow does not deploy the ChatGPT Site.

If no token is available, use a supported browser's WebMCP testing flag or the
normal fallback. WebMCP availability also depends on the page's origin-isolated
browsing context and `tools` Permissions Policy. A successful HTTP response or
an active VT Code pairing does not, by itself, prove that native browser WebMCP
is available.

## Verification checklist

For either deployment:

1. Open the page directly and confirm the expected URL and fallback editor.
2. In a supported WebMCP browser, inspect the page and confirm the eight
   registered tools, bounded results, and `get_editor_state.webmcp_context`.
3. Start **Evidence** before a real inspector or ChatGPT in-app-browser run;
   keep the sanitized JSON beside the screenshot or recording.
4. For workspace access, pair using the exact origin table above and paste the
   URL/code printed by the same TUI.
5. Confirm browser edits remain proposals and that approval, apply, checks,
   and revert stay behind the VT Code terminal or configured headless policy.
