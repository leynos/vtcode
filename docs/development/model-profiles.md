Model profiles and provider API format

This short development note describes the TOML shape used by VT Code to express provider-level API format hints, capability defaults, and sparse per-model profiles. It is intended for maintainers and integrators; end-users should prefer the higher-level guidance in the Configuration guide.

Provider-level fields (in `[[custom_providers]]`)

- api_format = "auto" | "openai-chat" | "openai-responses" | "anthropic-messages"
  - Optional hint that describes the provider's preferred API shape.
  - `auto` or omitted: preserve legacy autodetection and existing metadata flows.
  - Explicit value: instructs VT Code to use the specified API shape. VT Code will not silently fallback to another format when an explicit value is given.

- context_window = <integer tokens> (optional)
  - Provider capability in tokens. Drives UI context sizing, compaction thresholds, and preflight token checks.
  - When omitted VT Code uses the provider/model default (commonly 128000 for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints unless otherwise discovered).

- `supports_tools`, `supports_reasoning`, `supports_reasoning_effort`, `supports_vision`, `supports_structured_output`, `supports_parallel_tool_calls`, `supports_context_caching`, `supports_responses_compaction`, and `supports_context_edits` (optional booleans)
  - Provider-level conservative defaults applied when per-model metadata is unavailable.

Per-model profiles (sparse overrides)

Profiles live under a top-level table keyed by the literal path `custom_providers.profiles."<model-id>"`. Each profile is intentionally sparse — list only the overrides you need.

Example:

[custom_providers.profiles."gpt-5.6-sol"]
api_format = "openai-responses"
context_window = 131072
supports_tools = true
supports_vision = false
supports_structured_output = true
supports_parallel_tool_calls = true

Notes and semantics

- model / models remain the allowlist/defaults used to control the `/model` picker and what models are available. Profiles do NOT make a model available; they only modify runtime defaults for a model identifier that is already selectable.
- Precedence (highest wins): profile > provider defaults > model metadata / autodetect > conservative fallback.
- Explicit boolean `false` is honoured and may override an implicit `true` from a lower-precedence layer.
- Omitting `api_format` preserves legacy behaviour. Setting `api_format` explicitly instructs VT Code to treat the model with that API shape; it does not cause silent fallbacks.

Keep examples small and conservative: prefer to declare only the fields you need to correct autodetection or to provide conservative capability signals for gateways that omit detailed model descriptors.
