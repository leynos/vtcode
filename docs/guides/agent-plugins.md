# Agent Plugins

VT Code supports the [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) portable package format. A plugin is a directory containing a root `plugin.json` manifest, optional `skills/*/SKILL.md` Agent Skills, and optional `mcp.json` MCP server configuration.

For a task-oriented walkthrough, see the [Agent Plugins User Guide](../user-guide/agent-plugins.md).

## Directory layout

```text
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json
├── skills/
│   └── my-skill/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       ├── scripts/
│       └── references/
├── mcp.json
└── com.vtcode.client/
    └── hooks/
```

## Manifest

`plugin.json` requires two fields:

- `$schema` — must reference the Agent Plugins schema (`https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/plugin.schema.json`)
- `name` — 1-64 characters of `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`; must start and end alphanumeric and must not contain `--` or `..`

Other recognized fields (`version`, `description`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords`, `extensions`) are optional. Unknown top-level fields are non-fatal and reported.

## Discovery roots

VT Code discovers plugins from two roots:

- **Project plugin root**: `<workspace>/.agents/plugins/`
- **User plugin root**: `~/.agents/plugins/`

Each immediate child directory containing a valid root `plugin.json` is treated as a plugin. Directories without a valid `plugin.json` fall back to generic skill discovery (preserving backward compatibility with existing `.agents/plugins` layouts).

The two roots are used differently:

- **Skills** are discovered from both roots: the project root takes precedence over the user root.
- **MCP servers** are discovered from both roots at session startup.
- **`plugins list` and `plugins info`** scan both roots.

## Example usage

[`vinhnx/vtcode-plugins`](https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode-plugins) is a real, open-source plugin that bundles nine general-purpose Agent Skills extracted from VT Code itself (Rust coding rules, codemod migrations, code review, workspace analysis, and more).

```bash
# Install from GitHub
vtcode plugins add https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode-plugins.git

# Confirm the install
vtcode plugins list
vtcode plugins info vtcode-plugins

# Use a bundled skill in a session
# Ask the agent: "Use the rust-skills skill"
```

After installing, the skills are loaded at the next session start and are available to the agent like any other skill. Installable project-locally instead:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/plugins
git clone https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode-plugins.git .agents/plugins/vtcode-plugins
```

## Skills

Plugin skills are discovered from `skills/*/SKILL.md` (immediate children of `skills/` only). Each skill must pass the strict Agent Skills validation that VT Code applies: `name` matches the parent directory, `description` is required, and only supported frontmatter keys are allowed.

## MCP servers

Plugin MCP servers are declared in `mcp.json`. VT Code supports:

- `stdio` transport: `command`, `args`, `env`, `cwd`
- `streamable-http` transport: `url`, `headers`

The legacy `sse` transport is parsed but skipped (unsupported by VT Code's MCP client).

At session startup each plugin MCP server is exposed as an MCP provider named `<plugin-name>.<server-name>` (for example, `my-plugin.local`), available through `/mcp` like any other configured server.

### Environment expansion

For stdio servers, VT Code injects `PLUGIN_ROOT` and `PLUGIN_DATA` environment variables and expands `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` and `${PLUGIN_DATA}` placeholders in `args`, `env` values, and `cwd`. `PLUGIN_DATA` defaults to `<plugin-root>/data` and is created automatically before the subprocess launches.

### Path containment

`./`-prefixed paths in `command` and `cwd` must resolve within the plugin root; symlink resolution is applied so a symlink that points outside the plugin root is rejected. Resolved paths are canonicalized eagerly before the subprocess is spawned. Names passed to `plugins add --name` and `plugins remove` must satisfy the same rules as manifest names, so a crafted name cannot escape the plugins directory.

## CLI

```bash
vtcode plugins list
vtcode plugins info <name>
vtcode plugins validate <path>
vtcode plugins add <git-url-or-local-path> --name <id>
vtcode plugins remove <name>
```

`plugins add` installs to `~/.agents/plugins/<name>`: git URLs are cloned with `git clone --depth=1`, and local directories are copied after verifying they contain a valid `plugin.json`. `plugins remove` uninstalls from the user plugin root.

## Config

Plugin behaviour is controlled by the existing `tools.plugins` section in `vtcode.toml`:

```toml
[tools.plugins]
enabled = true
default_trust = "sandbox"
allow = ["my-plugin"]
deny = []
auto_reload = true
```

`default_trust` accepts `sandbox` (default), `trusted`, or `untrusted`. See the [Configuration Field Reference](../config/CONFIG_FIELD_REFERENCE.md) for the full set of `tools.plugins.*` options.

## Conformance

VT Code is a conformant Agent Plugins client for both component types (skills + stdio/streamable-http MCP). See the [Agent Plugins specification](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) for the portable package contract.
