# VT Code user directories

VT Code resolves all VT Code-owned user-level files through
`vtcode_commons::VtCodePaths`. The resolver follows the XDG Base Directory
Specification on Linux and BSD, and native application-data conventions on
macOS and Windows. Workspace-local `.vtcode` state is deliberately unchanged.

For practical setup, diagnostics, and rollback instructions, see the
[user data directories guide](../guides/user-data-directories.md).

## Directory categories

On Linux and BSD, the defaults below are relative to the user's home directory.
The application name is `vtcode`.

| Category | Environment variable | Default | Typical contents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Config | `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.config/vtcode` | `vtcode.toml`, update settings, agents, rules, MCP/tool policy, plugin manifests, auth files |
| Data | `XDG_DATA_HOME` | `~/.local/share/vtcode` | installed plugins and skills, durable downloads, catalogues and assets |
| State | `XDG_STATE_HOME` | `~/.local/state/vtcode` | sessions, persistent memory, scheduler/pod state, audit/debug logs, migration reports and backups |
| Cache | `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | `~/.cache/vtcode` | model/prompt/approval caches, web-fetch files, ast-grep data, large-output spools and update snapshots |
| Runtime | `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/vtcode` | transient sockets, locks and process coordination; falls back to `state/runtime` |
| Executable | `XDG_BIN_HOME` | `~/.local/bin` | managed helper binaries and updater-installed tools |

`VTCODE_CONFIG` and `VTCODE_DATA` override the corresponding canonical VT Code
roots. `VTCODE_HOME` names the legacy root used for compatibility and migration;
it does not replace the canonical XDG roots. Empty XDG values and relative XDG
values are ignored. Absolute explicit VT Code overrides are validated and fail
closed when unsafe.

System search roots follow XDG ordering. `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` and `XDG_DATA_DIRS`
are parsed as ordered, absolute path lists; invalid entries are ignored. Their
defaults are `/etc/xdg` and `/usr/local/share:/usr/share`. `/etc/vtcode`
remains an explicit compatibility configuration location.

Configuration is merged from lowest to highest precedence:

1. `/etc/vtcode` and `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS` system candidates;
2. the legacy user config under `VTCODE_HOME` or `~/.vtcode`;
3. the canonical user config under the resolved `VTCODE_CONFIG` or XDG config
   directory;
4. project and workspace config layers;
5. an explicit `VTCODE_CONFIG_PATH` file as the highest file-based override;
6. runtime and CLI overrides.

User writes always use the canonical user config path, even when a legacy or
system file supplied the value that was read. Optional inaccessible system and
user candidates are skipped. A present malformed file, an explicit
`VTCODE_CONFIG_PATH`, or a workspace-file error remains actionable and includes
the path in its diagnostic.

## Platform roots

- Linux/BSD use the six XDG categories above.
- macOS uses Application Support for config/data, a native cache directory for
  cache, a private state subdirectory for mutable state, and the managed binary
  directory selected by VT Code.
- Windows uses native application-data and local-app-data roots, with separate
  config, data, state, cache and binary children.

Run `vtcode --version` to print the resolved config, data, state, cache,
runtime, executable, legacy and migration paths.

## Legacy migration and rollback

At startup, before normal configuration loading, VT Code scans the legacy root
once. It maps legacy files by category into canonical roots, copies only
regular files and directories, never follows symlinks or special files, and
never overwrites an existing destination. Files are published through private
temporary siblings and an atomic no-replace operation. The legacy directory is
never deleted, so it remains a rollback-safe backup.

The mapping is explicit: configuration files, `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, rules,
prompts, commands, tool policy, MCP configuration and auth move to config;
plugins, skills, durable assets, legacy `tools/` and `bin/` move to data or the
executable directory; projects, sessions, memory, scheduler/pod state, logs,
audits and backups move to state; and model/prompt/approval caches, installer
state, web-fetch files and large-output spools move to cache. Unknown
top-level legacy entries are retained and recorded as unmapped rather than
silently reclassified.

Migration writes a versioned marker and a JSON report under the state directory
only after the scan completes. The report records copied, skipped, conflicting
and failed entries. Individual copy failures are nonfatal; VT Code continues
using the legacy fallback where a destination was not created. If a retryable
failure occurs, the report is still written but the completion marker is
withheld, so the next startup retries the failed entries. Once the marker is
published, later runs are idempotent.

Legacy `tmp/` content is intentionally not migrated. New transient files use
the runtime/cache policy, while the old directory remains available only for
compatibility and is not automatically removed.

To roll back a migration, stop VT Code, keep the new roots as a backup, remove
the migration marker from `<state>/migration/legacy-v1.complete`, and start
with `VTCODE_HOME` pointing at the preserved legacy directory. Resolve any
destination conflicts manually; VT Code will not overwrite them.

Authentication lookup also checks legacy `auth.json` locations when startup
migration is bypassed. New credentials are always written under the canonical
private config/auth directory. Auth directories use mode `0700` and auth files
use mode `0600` on Unix. Newly created user roots are private; existing
directories are not made more restrictive unless they hold security-sensitive
runtime or credential data.

## Compatibility boundaries

The following roots are external compatibility surfaces and are not VT Code
migration targets:

- workspace `.vtcode` files such as IPC, code-temp, dynamic context, plans and
  workspace sessions;
- `.agents`, `.codex`, `.claude`, `CODEX_HOME`, and system skill directories.

VT Code may read those locations for interoperability, but it does not move or
reclassify their contents.
