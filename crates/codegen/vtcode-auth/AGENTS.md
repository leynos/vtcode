[Root AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) | OAuth PKCE flows and credential storage for
LLM providers.

## Modules

`openai_chatgpt_oauth/` OpenAI ChatGPT OAuth | `openai_refresh_policy/` pure
refresh classification | `openai_session_storage/` typed session persistence |
`openrouter_oauth/` OpenRouter OAuth | `openrouter_token_storage/` typed token
persistence | `mcp_oauth/` MCP server OAuth | `oauth_server/` local callback
server | `pkce/` PKCE challenge generation | `credentials/` credential storage
(keyring + file) | `auth_service/` OpenAIAccountAuthService | `config/`
AuthConfig types | `storage_paths/` path resolution

## Rules

- All OAuth flows use PKCE — `generate_pkce_challenge()` is the entry point.
- `credentials::CredentialStorage` supports keyring and file-based backends.
- `oauth_server::run_auth_code_callback_server` starts a local HTTP server for
  OAuth callbacks.
- Re-exported from `vtcode-config::auth` for backward compat — canonical code
  is here.

## Gotchas

- `clear_openai_chatgpt_session_with_mode()` and
  `clear_oauth_token_with_mode()` accept storage mode — use the `_with_mode`
  variants for explicit control.
- MCP OAuth is separate from provider OAuth — `mcp_oauth::McpOAuthService`
  handles it.
- `credentials::keyring_entry` short-circuits when `keyring_disabled()` is true
  (`cfg!(debug_assertions)`, `cfg!(test)`, `VTCODE_DISABLE_KEYRING`, or `CI`),
  so debug builds, tests, and CI fall back to file storage and never trigger
  macOS Keychain prompts. Debug-keyring can be re-enabled with
  `VTCODE_DISABLE_KEYRING=0`. `is_keyring_functional()` caches its result to
  avoid repeated Keychain round trips.
- API-key writes verify a secure-storage read-back; keep the configured
  `AuthCredentialsStoreMode` consistent between writes and runtime resolution.
  Encrypted auth directories are private (`0700`) and credential files are
  private (`0600`).
- API-key storage is scoped by normalized `(provider, key_name)`; `key_name` is
  normally the resolved environment variable. Provider-only entries are legacy
  fallbacks and may be migrated only for the provider default key, never for an
  ambiguous non-default profile.
- `read_private_file` is strict about regular files and Unix `0600`-compatible
  permissions; compatibility lookup uses `read_legacy_compatible_file` so
  canonical auth paths stay strict while true legacy rollback candidates remain
  readable until copied.
- `OpenRouterToken` has a redacted `Debug` implementation, and token-exchange
  errors must not include response bodies that could echo secrets.
- `openai_refresh_policy` returns a clear/preserve action only; storage
  deletion stays in the orchestration layer.
